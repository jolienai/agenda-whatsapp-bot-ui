# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

# Project structure


## Description

- **`components/`**: This directory contains all your reusable UI components. Each component has its own directory with corresponding JavaScript/JSX, CSS/SCSS, and other related files.

- **`pages/`**: If your app has multiple pages or routes, store them in this directory. Each page has its own directory with corresponding JavaScript/JSX, CSS/SCSS, and other related files.

- **`services/`**: This directory holds utility functions or services that are used across the app, such as API calls or helper functions.

- **`contexts/`**: If you're using the context API or a state management library like Redux, place your global state management logic here.

- **`assets/`**: Store static files like images, fonts, and other media files in this directory.

- **`App.js`**: The main component of your app.

- **`index.js`**: The entry point of your app where you render your top-level component.

- **`AppRouter.js`** (if using React Router): A file for managing routes, if client-side routing is implemented.

- **`.gitignore`**: This file specifies which files and directories should be ignored by Git.

- **`package.json`**: The file that holds various metadata relevant to the project.

- **`README.md`**: This file contains information about the project, its structure, and how to run it.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
4. Start the development server with `npm start`.

## Additional Notes

- Customize this structure based on your specific project requirements.
- Consider using linting and formatting tools for consistent code style.
- Add any additional configuration files or folders as needed.

Feel free to modify this structure to suit your project's needs. Happy coding!
